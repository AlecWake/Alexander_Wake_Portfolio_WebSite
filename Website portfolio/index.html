        Hi, I'm Alexander Wake, an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of North Dakota. I have strong experience with Python and Java, and I’ve also explored C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My primary passion lies in software engineering, but I have a broad interest in all fields of Computer Science.

    <!-- Long Bio Section (Initially Hidden) -->
    <p id="long-bio" style="display:none;">
        During my first two years at UND, I’ve gained a deep understanding of fundamental CS concepts, utilizing languages like Python, Java, and C++ to implement core concepts and explore their use cases. I’ve maintained a 3.94 GPA and have been on the Dean's List for all four semesters.
        <br><br>
        As I move forward in my studies, my goal is to gain hands-on experience in any CS position to further build my skills and grow professionally. I’m particularly interested in working on projects related to software engineering, AI, and machine learning.
        <br><br>
        Outside of my academic and programming pursuits, I enjoy playing basketball, watching professional and collegiate sports, and staying active through workouts. I believe in the importance of maintaining a balance between work and personal life, which allows me to stay motivated and focused.
